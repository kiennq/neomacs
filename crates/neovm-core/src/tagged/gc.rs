//! Mark-sweep garbage collector for the tagged pointer value system.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - **Cons cells**: GNU-shaped aligned block allocator.
//!   Each `ConsBlock` stores a fixed-size array of `ConsCell` at the front of
//!   a 64KB-aligned block, followed by packed mark bits. This lets the GC
//!   derive a cons's owning block/index directly from the pointer, matching the
//!   structure GNU Emacs uses in `alloc.c`.
//!
//! - **Floats, strings, vectors**: SIZE-CLASS OBJECT ARENA PAGES (the
//!   non-cons allocator modernization, stage 3) — 64KB-aligned pages of
//!   fixed-stride slots (Float 32B, String 64B, Vector 64B) with a per-page
//!   allocation bitmap and free list. Page objects keep their `GcHeader`;
//!   ownership is the PAGE-SPAN ORACLE (per-class page-base registry +
//!   stride + alloc bit), NOT the addr-set, and they never join the
//!   intrusive lists; dedicated page sweeps reclaim them.
//!
//! - **All other heap objects** (non-Vector vectorlikes): allocated
//!   via the system allocator, linked via intrusive `GcHeader.next` list
//!   for sweeping, with an address index for O(1) ownership checks during
//!   marking.
//!
//! - **Mark phase**: walk from roots, decode tags, follow heap pointers.
//! - **Sweep phase**: walk cons blocks (bitmap), object arena pages
//!   (bitmap), and the intrusive list (GcHeader chain), freeing unmarked
//!   objects.
//!
//! No ObjId. No generations. No stale references.

// `Box::from_raw` would corrupt the heap on a page pointer. The OWNERSHIP
// ORACLE for a page object is the page-span test (`ObjectArena::owns`):
// page-base registry hit + stride alignment + ALLOC-BIT-SET. The page sweep

// (`promote_and_blacken` flips `header.tenured` on every allocated slot at
// the one-time first partition cycle; the intrusive-list splice never sees
// them). The per-object `header.tenured` remains the SOLE mark-path
// authority; no page-level flag is consulted by any mark path. Pages that
// are FULL of tenured slots at promotion are RETIRED: never swept, never
// allocated into, freed only at heap teardown — but they STAY in the
// ownership oracle, because `value_is_tenured` (and through it the
// remembered-set write barrier) gates on ownership: a retired-page tenured
// object that answered "not owned" would miss its first post-retirement
// tenured→young edge and its child would be swept while live (UAF). Pages
// left with a mix of tenured + free/young slots stay in rotation as MIXED

    ///    feed into `live_bytes`.
