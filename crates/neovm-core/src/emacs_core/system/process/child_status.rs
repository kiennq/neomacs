//! GNU's asynchronous child-status recording (`handle_child_signal`,
//! src/process.c:7691), and the type that keeps Lisp from seeing an exited
//! child as running.
//!
//! # What GNU does, and where
//!
//! `handle_child_signal` is the SIGCHLD handler.  It walks the process alist
//! itself and stamps every child whose state changed:
//!
//! ```c
//!   FOR_EACH_PROCESS (tail, proc)                          /* :7734 */
//!     {
//!       struct Lisp_Process *p = XPROCESS (proc);
//!       int status;
//!
//!       if (p->alive
//!           && child_status_changed (p->pid, &status,
//!                                    WUNTRACED | WCONTINUED))   /* :7741-7742 */
//!         {
//!           changed = true;
//!           p->tick = ++process_tick;                      /* :7745 */
//!           p->raw_status = status;                        /* :7746 */
//!           p->raw_status_new = 1;                         /* :7747 */
//!
//!           if (WIFSIGNALED (status) || WIFEXITED (status)) /* :7750 */
//!             {
//!               bool clear_desc_flag = 0;
//!               p->alive = 0;                              /* :7752 */
//!               if (p->infd >= 0) clear_desc_flag = 1;
//!               if (clear_desc_flag) delete_read_fd (p->infd);   /* :7760 */
//!             }
//!         }
//!     }
//!   if (changed) child_signal_notify ();                   /* :7766-7767 */
//! ```
//!
//! Its own header states the contract in one sentence (:7668-7671):
//!
//! ```text
//!    All we do is change the status; we do not run sentinels or print
//!    notifications.  That is saved for the next time keyboard input is
//!    done, in order to avoid timing errors.
//! ```
//!
//! So the recording is *only* a recording, and the notification is
//! `status_notify`'s job (:7862).  The consequence is Lisp-visible and is
//! what this module exists for: in GNU, `(process-live-p exited-child)` is
//! `nil` with nobody having called `accept-process-output` or waited at all.
//!
//! # Why the sweep is NOT in a signal handler here
//!
//! GNU's own comments above `handle_child_signal` enumerate what a SIGCHLD
//! handler may legitimately do, and the list is short (:7673-7688):
//!
//! * *"** WARNING: this can be called during garbage collection.  Therefore,
//!   it must not be fooled by the presence of mark bits in Lisp objects."*
//! * *"** Malloc WARNING: This should never call malloc either directly or
//!   indirectly; if it does, that is a bug."*
//!
//! and `child_signal_notify` (:7616-7650) carries the third, with a stack
//! trace as evidence: an `emacs_perror` was REMOVED from the handler because
//! `strerror_l` is not reentrant and reaches `malloc` through the locale
//! machinery.  All the handler is allowed to do at the end is
//! `emacs_write (fd, &dummy, 1)` to a self-pipe.
//!
//! Those three constraints are the whole design input, and in a Rust port
//! they are decisive.  This port's process table is a
//! `HashMap<ProcessId, Process>` owned by the Lisp thread; a signal is
//! delivered to an arbitrary thread (which is why GNU has
//! `deliver_process_signal`'s FORWARD_SIGNAL_TO_MAIN_THREAD, src/sysdep.c:
//! 1729-1751), and reading that map from a handler while the Lisp thread
//! mutates it is a data race, not merely a lock-order problem.  Iterating it
//! allocates.  So the sweep cannot live where GNU's lives.
//!
//! What CAN live in a handler is exactly what GNU puts there at the end: a
//! byte on a self-pipe.  That is a wake-up, and it changes no Lisp answer --
//! it only decides how soon a safe point is reached.  This port already has
//! the wake-up in another form: a `pidfd` per child, registered with the wait
//! poller (`sys::ChildStatusSource`), which makes the poller return the
//! moment a child terminates.
//!
//! **So the recording is placed where it is safe, and WHICH safe point is the
//! whole question.**  Ledger 193 chose `Context::maybe_quit` -- GNU's
//! `pending_signals` check -- and that was wrong.  Ledger 198 moved it to
//! GNU's own site and made the move a type; the reasoning is below and the
//! enforcement is
//! [`WaitStatusNotifySite`](crate::emacs_core::wait::WaitStatusNotifySite).
//! Separately, a subr still cannot report a status without naming where its
//! record came from: [`ObservedProcess`] has private fields, and the
//! constructor that observes takes an [`UpdateStatusSite`] naming which of
//! GNU's eight `update_status` lines the caller is.
//!
//! # Where GNU puts it, and why `maybe_quit` is not it
//!
//! GNU's own comment says the recording exists so that the answer is ready
//! *"the next time keyboard input is done"* (:7669-7671) -- and the function
//! that does keyboard input is `wait_reading_process_output`.  Reading the
//! call graph rather than the phrase says the same thing three ways:
//!
//! * `process_pending_signals`, which is all `maybe_quit` reaches
//!   (src/lisp.h:3896-3900 -> src/eval.c:1868-1876), is
//!   `pending_signals = false; handle_async_input (); do_pending_atimers ();`
//!   (src/keyboard.c:8367-8372).  `grep -c status_notify` over it is **0**.
//! * `handle_child_signal` never sets `pending_signals` at all: `grep -n
//!   'pending_signals = ' src/*.c` returns eleven lines and **not one is in
//!   `process.c`**.  Its wake is `child_signal_notify`, a byte on the
//!   self-pipe the `select` inside the wait is watching.
//! * All five `status_notify` calls are `Fdelete_process` (:1129, :1149),
//!   `process_send_signal`'s SIGCONT arm (:7181) -- three subrs notifying a
//!   status they wrote themselves on the line above -- and
//!   `wait_reading_process_output` (:5554, :5854).  **Every status GNU
//!   discovers asynchronously is notified from the wait.**
//!
//! GNU says why in its own words, at :3413 and again at :6160: *"Execute the
//! sentinel here.  If we had relied on status_notify to do it later, it will
//! read input from the process before calling the sentinel."*
//!
//! # What the wrong safe point cost, measured
//!
//! With the record made at `maybe_quit`, a status became Lisp-visible at a
//! moment when no wait was running, so `(while (process-live-p p)
//! (accept-process-output nil 0.02))` -- the commonest process idiom there is
//! -- could exit its loop with the sentinel unrun.  Programs depend on the
//! opposite: `magit-run-post-commit-hook` is keyed on `last-command`, which
//! its caller binds AROUND that loop.  100 runs per shape, `-Q --batch`,
//! counting only the runs in which the loop actually entered a wait:
//!
//! ```text
//!                              entered a wait   sentinel inside the let
//!   GNU 31.0.90                       294               294
//!   this port, drain at maybe_quit    300               261
//! ```
//!
//! and `treemacs_magit_package_batch`'s
//! `extending_a_real_commit_schedules_the_same_project_refresh` failed
//! deterministically with `(error "Treemacs-Magit idle update was not
//! scheduled")` -- which is exactly what ledger 180 measured when it declined
//! the synchronous sweep, and for the same reason.
//!
//! # What that costs, stated rather than buried
//!
//! GNU's handler *reaps* the child (`child_status_changed` -> `waitpid`), so
//! GNU answers these with nobody having waited at all, and this port does not:
//!
//! ```text
//!                                          GNU 31.0.90   here
//!   (process-status p) after a pure spin       exit       run
//!   (process-attributes pid) 'state            nil        "Z"
//!   (signal-process p 0)                       -1         0
//! ```
//!
//! Those are ledger 180 §9.1-9.2 and ledger 184's rows 2 and 3, and they are
//! PINNED divergences again.  The only safe point that closes them is GNU's
//! own -- the handler -- and a Rust port cannot walk this table there.  Ledger
//! 187 §8.1(b) asked for "a safe point that is not a Lisp observation"; the
//! answer is that GNU has none either.  GNU's safe point for child status IS a
//! Lisp observation: the wait.
//!
//! # The pipe is not a child, and cannot be swept
//!
//! `handle_child_signal` passes `p->pid` to `child_status_changed`, and
//! `get_child_status` opens with `eassert (child > 0)` (src/sysdep.c:461).
//! A pipe, network or serial connection has no pid, so the handler cannot
//! reach it; its status changes in exactly one other place --
//! `read_process_output` returning 0 (:6072-6079), which is inside the wait.
//! Ledger 165's finding is that `process-live-p` therefore means the
//! OPPOSITE thing for a pipe, and a fix keyed on "the child exited" that
//! touched pipes would be wrong for half the process kinds.
//!
//! [`SweepableChild`] is that rule as a type: it carries the OS pid, and its
//! only constructor is the membership test.  A pidless process is not
//! skipped by an `if` inside the loop -- it cannot be built, so it cannot be
//! in the population.
