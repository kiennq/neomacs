// Neomacs replay process sample the clock seconds apart -- and, across a
// midnight boundary, on different days -- so that output is non-deterministic.
//
// Rather than scrub every timestamp format out of the serialized result with
// bespoke regexes (an open-ended, error-prone game of whack-a-mole -- a greedy
// pattern can silently mask a *real* divergence), the tests that need it opt
// into a frozen clock: both subprocesses run under libfaketime pinned to one
// fixed instant, so their raw output already agrees with no normalization.
// libfaketime interposes glibc's `clock_gettime`/`gettimeofday`, which is the
// one layer both engines share (GNU's C `current_timespec` and Neomacs's Rust
// `std::time` both bottom out there), so it catches even `format-time-string`,
// which reads the C clock directly and would slip past a Lisp-level redefinition
// of `current-time`.
