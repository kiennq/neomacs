//! The identity of the GNU Emacs build every parity number is measured against.
//!
//! # Why this crate exists (ledger 214)
//!
//! Ledger 210 taught this project that a count must carry the frame it was
//! measured in, and ledger 210 and 211 made every parity harness fail loudly
//! when the reference editor could not be RUN.  Neither checked *which* editor
//! ran.  A reference that VANISHED was caught; a reference that CHANGED --- a
//! rebuild of the shared GNU mirror --- would have been scored in silence, and
//! the mirror is one successful `make` away from producing a different binary
//! at the same path.
//!
//! This crate is the single place that answers "is the GNU in front of me the
//! GNU our numbers are about?", and [`ReferenceUse::stamp`] is the string a
//! published number carries so that the answer travels with it.
//!
//! # What identifies a build
//!
//! GNU already computes a build identity and this crate uses GNU's own.
//! `lib/fingerprint.h` declares `volatile unsigned char fingerprint[32]` and
//! says it exists so that we "have a unique value that we can use to pair data
//! files (like a dump file) with a specific build of Emacs".
//! `lib-src/make-fingerprint.c` computes it as a SHA-256 over the `temacs`
//! executable and patches it into the binary in place; `src/pdumper.c:4198`
//! copies it into the dump header, and `src/pdumper.c:5687` refuses to load a
//! dump whose fingerprint differs from the binary's compiled-in one.
//!
//! So the 32 bytes at offset 16 of the `.pdmp` --- immediately after the
//! 16-byte magic `DUMPEDGNUEMACS\0\0` (`src/pdumper.c:116`) --- identify the
//! binary and its dump as a pair, and reading them costs one 48-byte read.
//! Measured on the pinned build, those bytes equal the `pdumper-fingerprint`
//! the running binary reports (`src/pdumper.c:5908`).
//!
//! The pinned binary carries no `.note.gnu.build-id`: it is stripped and the
//! link emitted none, so the ELF note that would otherwise be the cheap
//! identity is not available.  The fingerprint is.
//!
//! # Two depths, and what each is worth
//!
//! [`AttestationDepth`] is an enum rather than a bool because the two depths
//! answer different questions and cost different amounts:
//!
//! * [`AttestationDepth::Fingerprint`] validates the dump magic, the 32-byte
//!   build fingerprint, and both file sizes.  It costs one 48-byte read and two
//!   `stat` calls.  It catches every REBUILD, which is the incident this crate
//!   exists for, because a rebuild necessarily produces a new `temacs` and
//!   therefore a new fingerprint.
//! * [`AttestationDepth::Exhaustive`] additionally verifies the SHA-256 of the
//!   executable and of the dump.  It is the complete content identity and also
//!   catches a shipped file edited after the build, which the fingerprint
//!   cannot: the fingerprint is computed over `temacs` at build time, not over
//!   the artifacts that ship.  Measured on the pinned build it reads 18.7 MB
//!   and costs roughly 70 ms.
//!
//! A harness picks the depth its cost budget allows and *says which it used* in
//! its published stamp, so the strength of the check travels with the number
//! the same way the geometry does.
//!
//! # Refusal is the default
//!
//! [`ReferenceUse::Unpinned`] exists because a pin nobody can run without is a
//! pin people delete: a developer or CI without the mirror sets
//! `NEOMACS_PARITY_REFERENCE=none` and every number they produce is stamped
//! `UNATTESTED`.  It cannot be reached by accident --- absent that variable, a
//! reference that does not match is an [`AttestationError`], never a warning.
