//! Tiered execution subsystem for the Emacs-Lisp VM — the foundation of the
//! modern JIT path. See `bytecode/ELISP_VM_MODERNIZATION.md` for the full
//! design + phased roadmap.
//!
//! Gated behind the `jit` cargo feature, which is **default-ON** (`default =
//! ["jit"]`): both the baseline (Tier-1) Cranelift JIT and the optimizing
//! typed-MIR Tier-2 above it are qualified and shipping. The bytecode
//! interpreter (`bytecode::Vm`) is always the **Tier 0** engine — the
//! correctness oracle that mirrors GNU Emacs 31.0.90 and the deoptimization
//! landing pad. It is never removed.
//!
//! Design rule (carried over from the GC work): every dispatch over an
//! execution tier is an **exhaustive `match`** with no catch-all arm, so adding
//! a tier fails to compile until every site handles it. That is the same
//! compiler-enforced completeness that caught the GC `trace_veclike`
//! use-after-free (an incomplete duplicate with a `_ => {}` arm).
//!
//! # Environment-knob inventory (the authoritative list)
//!
//! Every runtime toggle this subsystem reads, with default and status. Grep
//! anchor: `env::var("NEOVM_`. Keep this table in sync when adding a knob, and
//! give every OPT-IN knob a graduation plan — soak → default-on, or delete —
//! so the surface doesn't accumulate permanently-dead branches.
//!
//! ## Runtime switches (shipping, default-on)
//! | Knob | Default | Meaning |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `NEOVM_JIT` | on | Kill switch: `0`/`off`/`false`/`no` forces the pure interpreter (the A/B baseline). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_THRESHOLD` | 1000 | Tier-up heat threshold ([`Runtime::HOT_THRESHOLD`]); `=1` compiles every compilable function — the differential soak and the strictest oracle configuration. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_LOOP_HEAT` | 8 | Heat credited per 256-iteration back-edge wrap (32 iterations ≈ one call; a hot loop tiers up near 32k iterations); `=0` disables loop heat — the pre-loop-heat baseline. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_LEVER1` | on | Residual-rooting non-heap skip; `=off` reverts to an unconditional gc_push per residual (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_OSR` | on | Mid-loop interpreter→native transfer (on-stack replacement); `=off` disables. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_PROFIT` | on | Profitability gate (calls ≤ arith); `=off` also compiles call-heavy bodies. |
//!
//! ## Opt-in features (default-OFF, pending a graduation decision)
//! | Knob | Enable | Meaning / graduation blocker |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE_ARITH` | `=on` | Level-B native bit-ops (logand/logior/logxor/lognot) with fixnum-guard deopt. Blocker: skips the compiler-macro bounce; a mixed-type loop falls back to the interpreter ungracefully. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_GATE_RELAX` | `=on` | Relax the calls ≤ arith profit gate. Default-on was tried and REVERTED (regressed byte-compile 21%) — measure byte-compile before ever re-flipping. |
//!
//! ## Measurement / bisection
//! | Knob | Meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_MAX_ID` | Compile only functions with id ≤ N (ids assigned in first-hot order) — clean prefix bisection of a misbehaving workload. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_DEBUG_ID` | Dump the bytecode body of the one compiled function with this id. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_PROFILE` | Append per-function workload-characterization records to this file path. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_COMPILE_STATS` | `=1`: print a running compile-stall summary line every 64 compiles. |
//!
//! ## Verification harnesses (force the cold path everywhere; run the suite with each ON)
//! | Knob | Forces |
//! |---|---|
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_FORCE_DEOPT=1` | Every speculation guard fails → every deopt path executes. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_FORCE_SLOW_SPEC=1` | Every spec-call shim takes its stale-epoch re-validate branch on every call. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_FORCE_CBSYM_GENERIC=1` | Every CallBuiltinSym intrinsic bounces to its generic fallback. |
//!
//! ## AOT (`jit/aot.rs`)
//! | Knob | Meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `NEOVM_AOT` | `1`/`on`/`force` enables the AOT preload; `force` additionally warns when no usable preload loaded. |
//! | `NEOVM_AOT_PGO` | `1`/`on`/`force` enables PGO collection for the AOT function set. |
